# Configuring a web server for Textpattern

Textpattern CMS is supported on any web server that supports PHP, MySQL and either Apache or Nginx. While other web server platforms are suitable for housing a Textpattern instance, additional considerations should be made for the web hosting server environment. This article offers guidance and tips for administrators wishing to install Textpattern to both supported web server platforms and other, unsupported web servers.

The article's scope extends to the functional requirements of installing Textpattern on a existing production web server. It does not focus on installation of the web server software itself, security procedures for a production server or performance optimisations.

## Supported environments

* [Apache, MySQL, PHP](#apache-mysql-php)
* [Hiawatha, MariaDB, PHP-FPM](#hiawatha-mariadb-php-fpm)
* [Nginx, MySQL, PHP-FPM](#nginx-mysql-php-fpm)

### Apache, MySQL, PHP

Textpattern runs faster on current mainline versions of Apache, MySQL and PHP than end-of-life'd legacy versions. Typically, an existing production Apache web server with MySQL (or equivalent drop-in replacement) and PHP with appropriate extensions as listed in the [system requirements](https://textpattern.com/about/119/system-requirements) is enough to run Textpattern.

The method of enabling PHP extensions varies between versions of PHP and Apache, and also across operating systems. Refer to the system requirements above and contact your web hosting provider if you have queries.

Modifications to an Apache virtual host file are typically not needed, especially if PHP is already enabled. A `phpinfo()` pre-flight check is useful to confirm PHP and MySQL are functioning correctly. Create a `.php` file in the intended Textpattern location with the following contents:

~~~ php
<?php phpinfo(); ?>
~~~

Save the file as `preflight.php` or similar, and view it in a browser. If PHP is configured correctly, the resulting page will list details about PHP's configuration, including active extensions to check against the system requirements above. Delete this `preflight.php` file when you've confirmed system requirements are reached and, ideally, exceeded.

Textpattern-specific directives are provided by `.htaccess` in the root directory and other locations within the file tree. It is important to upload this file if your web server runs Apache as it's essentially direct instructions for the web server to work in a specific way. The root `.htaccess` file controls, among other things, clean URLs. Without `.htaccess`, clean URLs will not work.

### Hiawatha, MariaDB, PHP-FPM

Textpattern runs smoothly on a human-friendly Hiawatha web-server. Only a few of semantic data are required in your [virtual host section](//www.hiawatha-webserver.org/howto/websites) of a separate include or in the main `/etc/hiawatha/hiawatha.conf`:

~~~
VirtualHost {
	Hostname = www.my-website.com
	StartFile = index.php
	UseFastCGI = PHP7
	UseToolkit = textpattern
	WebsiteRoot = /var/www/my-website/public
	AccessLogfile = /var/log/hiawatha/my-website/access.log
	ErrorLogfile = /var/log/hiawatha/my-website/errors.log
#	TLScertFile = my-website.pem
#	RequireTLS = yes
}
~~~

Replace my-website.com to your own domain name and correct the path where needed. Type PHP5 instead of PHP7 if your host still does not support PHP7. Uncomment `TLSsertFile` line if you want to support secure connection. To forbid open access and switch HTTP to HTTPS only, uncomment also the directive `RequireTLS = yes`. Hiawatha has support for SNI, which allows us to serve multiple TLS websites via one IP address. Hiawatha also comes with a script to easily obtain and to automate renewing free Let's Encrypt certificates, according to your virtual host configuration.

Hiawatha does not need `.htaccess` file. If you wish clean semantic URLs, paste instead the following [URL Toolkit](//www.hiawatha-webserver.org/howto/url_toolkit) for [Textpattern](//www.hiawatha-webserver.org/howto/url_rewrite_rules) in the beginning of our include file for the virtual host or in the general `hiawatha.conf` file itself:

~~~
UrlToolkit {
	ToolkitID = textpattern
	RequestURI exists Return
	Match ^/(css|files|images)(/|$) Return
	Match ^/(favicon.ico|robots.txt|sitemap.xml)$ Return
	Match [^?]*(\?.*)? Rewrite /index.php$1
}
~~~

URL Toolkit could also be adopted for many other tasks, e. g. for URL 301 HTTP redirection:

~~~
UrlToolkit {
	ToolkitID = my-website
	Match ^/my-former-url-title Redirect /my-new-url-title
	Match ^/some-url Redirect //www.another-website.com/url-title
	Match ^/textpattern/ Redirect https://txp.my-website.com/textpattern/
}
~~~

Of course, we should point to this ToolkitID from our vhost section. You can also set some HTTP `CustomHeaderBackend` or `CustomHeaderClient` there for better performance, for example:

~~~
VirtualHost {
	...
	UseToolkit = my-website, textpattern
	UseDirectory = static
	CustomHeaderClient = Vary: accept-encoding
	...
}
~~~

Where `static` would include cache directives for your static assets:

~~~
Directory {
	DirectoryID = static
	Path = /css, /files, /images
	ExpirePeriod = 2 months, public
}
~~~

You can name your website by several domains — simply append its aliases in the same line of the virtual host section, separated by comma. Uncomment the `EnforceFirstHostname` directive if wanted to return webpages for visitors by only the first domain in your list (redirected 301):

~~~
VirtualHost {
	Hostname = www.my-website.com, my-website.com, our.org
#	EnforceFirstHostname = yes
	...
}
~~~

### Nginx, MySQL, PHP-FPM

Textpattern runs faster on current mainline versions of Nginx, MySQL and PHP than end-of-life'd legacy versions. Typically, an existing production Nginx web server with MySQL (or equivalent drop-in replacement) and PHP-FPM with appropriate extensions as listed in the [system requirements](https://textpattern.com/about/119/system-requirements) is enough to run Textpattern.

The method of enabling PHP-FPM extensions varies between versions of PHP-FPM and Nginx, and also across operating systems. Refer to the system requirements above and contact your web hosting provider if you have queries.

Modifications to the Nginx server block may be required as directives in `.htaccess` are ignored and not processed by Nginx. Take the following example Nginx `server` configuration with `upstream`'d PHP-FPM:

~~~ nginx
upstream php-fpm {
  server 127.0.0.1:9000;
}

server {
  listen [::]:80;
  listen 80;
  server_name example.com;
  root /sites/example.com/public;
  charset utf-8;
  location ~ /\. {
    deny all;
  }
  location / {
    index index.php;
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;
  }
  location ~ \.php$ {
    fastcgi_pass php-fpm;
    fastcgi_index index.php;
    include fastcgi_params;
    fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
  }
  #Inhibits direct file downloads
  #location ^~ /files/\.*$ {
  #  return 403;
  #}
  location ^~ /themes/\.txp$ {
    return 403;
  }
  types {
    image/svg+xml svg svgz;
  }
  gzip on;
  gzip_types image/svg+xml;
}
~~~

This `server` block includes a basic web hosting setup and translates the Apache-specific directives in `.htaccess` to an Nginx-native format. It can be used as a base for your Textpattern site.
